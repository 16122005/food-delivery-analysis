# Food Delivery Data Analysis

This project was completed as part of an internship entrance task.
It focuses on combining data from multiple sources to build a unified dataset.

The data includes order transactions, user details, and restaurant information,
provided in CSV, JSON, and SQL formats.

All datasets are merged using left joins to ensure no order data is lost.
The final dataset is used to analyze order trends, user behavior,
city-wise performance, and the impact of user membership on revenue.

The project is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
